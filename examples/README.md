# Examples and Sample Code

This directory contains examples and sample code for using FreshBooks with this SDK.

If you checkout the project, these files should be runnable locally after installing.

```shell
composer install
php ./examples/create_invoice.php
```

Be sure to update the example files with your own credentials in place of things like `<your client_id>`,
`<your account id>`, and `<your access token>`.
